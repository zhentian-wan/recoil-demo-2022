# Excalidraw Clone built with Recoil

This is the start of an [Exaclidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) clone that I am building with [Recoil](https://recoiljs.org/).

## What you'll learn to build in the course (on top of what's already in this repo)...

-   🔄 Rotating shapes
-   ✌️ Multi-select
-   🔵 More kinds of shapes
-   💾 Saving a drawing to a file and opening it again
-   🌍 Saving the drawing to a server (shareable drawing URL)
-   🌄 Loading content (e.g. images) from an API with Recoil and Suspense
-   👯‍♂️ Enabling concurrent mode
-   🧪 Adding full test coverage
-   🤔 Your own dev tools for debugging
-   🔑 Authentication
-   🏃 Performance debugging, testing, and improvement
-   And more...


### AtomFamily

For example, you have list of elements. We want to avoid that single elemenet got changed, whole list got re-render. Also want to share the single element state to other component. We can use `atom` (for list) and `atomFmaily` (for each element)

[PS] Using Redux with selector can also achieve this

for the list itself, you can use `atom` to model it.

for each elements in the list, can use `atomFamily`, it is a high order function which accept a param, for list of elements, the params would be the `id` of each element.

It is easy to get each element by using `useRecoilState(elementAtom(id))`, and those state are shareable with other component.


```tsx
// list
export const elementsAtom = atom<number[]>({
    key: 'elementsState',
    default: [],
})

// each element
export const elementAtom = atomFamily<Element, number>({
    key: 'elementState',
    default: {
        style: {
            position: {top: 50, left: 50},
            size: {width: 50, height: 50},
        },
    },
})

const [element, setElement] = useRecoilState(elementAtom(id))
```


### SelectorFamily

Benefits of Selectors:

* Get and Set logic combined
* Same API as Atoms
* Shareable, self-containaed state
